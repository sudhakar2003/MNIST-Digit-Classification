# MNIST-Digit-Classification
The MNIST digit classification project is a classic example of using deep learning to recognize handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset, which consists of 28x28 pixel grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9). Here's a description of the project components:

1. **Dataset**: The MNIST dataset contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images. Each image is a grayscale 28x28 pixel image, making a total of 784 features (28x28) for each image.

2. **Model Architecture**: A convolutional neural network (CNN) is commonly used for this task due to its effectiveness in image recognition tasks. The CNN typically consists of convolutional layers followed by pooling layers, and then fully connected layers at the end.

3. **Data Preprocessing**: Before feeding the images into the model, they are preprocessed to normalize the pixel values (usually to a range of [0, 1]) and reshape the images into the appropriate format for the CNN.

4. **Model Training**: The model is trained on the training images using an optimization algorithm such as stochastic gradient descent (SGD) or Adam. During training, the model learns to recognize patterns and features in the images that correspond to different digits.

5. **Model Evaluation**: The trained model is evaluated on the test images to measure its accuracy in correctly classifying digits. Metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score can be used to evaluate the model's performance.

6. **Prediction**: Once the model is trained and evaluated, it can be used to predict the digits in new images. The model takes an input image, processes it through the CNN, and outputs a prediction of the digit represented in the image.

Overall, the MNIST digit classification project demonstrates the application of deep learning, specifically CNNs, in recognizing handwritten digits with high accuracy, showcasing the power of deep learning in image recognition tasks.
